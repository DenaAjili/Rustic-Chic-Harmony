# Rustic-Chic-Harmony
The use of wood throughout the space not only adds a touch of rustic charm but also connects the indoors with nature. It's a perfect choice for the kitchen, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
The rich, green velvet fabric used for the sofas adds a pop of color and a sense of luxury. It's a testament to the idea that comfort and style can coexist seamlessly.
The use of glass to divide the living room from the corridor and other rooms is a testament to the power of transparency in design. It invites natural light to pour in, creating an open, airy ambiance.
